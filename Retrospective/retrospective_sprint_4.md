## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
    - We estimated tasks to the best of our abilities, we haven't found any particular reason for eventual errors in estimation

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
    - We keep refining our communication and organization as time goes on, some sprints teach us more than others, but we keep improving steadily
- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
    - Compared to the last sprint, where we missed one story, we were able to recover that story and also finish the ones we commited to.
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
    - We weren't able to increase the coverage above 90%, because we added a lot more code but we didn't have time to cover all the new lines and the ones that still had to be covered. Nevertheless, we still maintain a very close coverage to 90%


- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
    - Maintain the balance we found between the different tasks
    - Avoid creating significant technical debt

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!
    - We are proud of the work we did. Working together regularly was a new experience, but we're happy we were all in the same team
