## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)? 
  We have a small error margin, which we think is acceptable. This is better than our last restrospective, since we paid attention to estimatin no less than 112 hours.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  We think it'd be useful to commit less stories, and take more time to revisit old code, refactor it and clean it overall. We think our communication is getting better and we're definitely more comfortable using the tools we have, such as youtrack or github issues.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  Last time we wrote down that we wanted to do more stories, after further reflection, we thought this wasn't necessarily phrased well. We did end up doing a few more stories, but it won't be a future goal. We also met the goal of tracking better our tasks and preparing better for them, thanks to our previous sprint. We were more knowledgeable about the requirements and had overall an easier time due to this experience. 

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
N/A
- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

  > Propose one or two
  - Organize ourselves in such a way that different people can work independently and in parallel without any issues, this including the technical aspect (branches, conflicts etc)
  - Be able to finish the stories that we commit to, by choosing fewer ones and improve our estimation (thanks to the work we did for the previous sprint).
  - Better testing, including learning new technologies (for example, cypress for e2e testing) but also more coverage.
- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  We think we have a great team, we were able to all work together when it was needed, to progress further. Additionally, our skills and experiences are quite diverse, so we are able to cover a wider range of knowledge, including technologies but also best practices.
